PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  A program is required that asks a loan applicant to enter his / her credit score and the 
  program will decide whether the applicant is qualified for a loan or not based on the min  
  660 score requirement for the CVTC bank located in Eau Claire, WI. Then, for non-qualified 
  applicants, it will output and display the qualification results. If the applicant is 
  eligible, the will set a right interest rate for the credit score and ask the applicant to  
  enter a home value, downpayment percentage, loan start-year, and month. It will convert 1-12
  month input to a month name. Then, it will calculate the total downpayment, loan amount, 
  start date (mm, yyyy), payoff date, total cost of loan, monthly principal & interest, monthly 
  property tax, and monthly homeownerâ€™s insurance for a 10, 15, 20, 25 and a 30-year loan term. 
  Finally, it will display all the calculated results including the prompted inputs.

  NOTE: Set variable the interest rate at 7.63% if credit score is between 660 and 679
                                       at 7.13% if credit score is between 679 and 699
                                       at 6.99% if credit score is between 699 and 719
                                       at 6.87% if credit score is between 719 and 739
                                   and at 6.75% if credit score is 739 and above.
        Also, given property tax rate is 8.55% and the home insurance is estimated near the 1.88% of monthly loan payment.
